## Agent

This agent can go and load the youtube transcripts of videos, based on the URL. It then adds the transcripts into a vector store, creates a summary, key points, quotes and other information and stores it in a supabase DB. You then can chat about the videos. Ask for summaries, or follow up questions to sepecific videos. You can also search previously added videos. So, if you remember that a video was talking about a specific book, a specific tool, or a person, you can just ask the agent.
