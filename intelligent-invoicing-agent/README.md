# Intelligent Invoicing Agent

Author: [Tino Joel Muchenje](https://github.com/Tinomuchenje)

**Platform:** n8n (you can import the .json file into your own n8n to check out the flow)

An AI-powered invoice processing assistant that transforms invoice management from a tedious manual process into a conversational experience. It automatically extracts, processes, and manages invoice details, enabling users to query invoices in natural language (e.g., “Show me unpaid invoices from last month”). Built on a modern n8n workflow architecture with Supabase integration, it significantly reduces manual data entry, eliminates errors, and provides real-time insights for faster, smarter financial decisions.

## Features

- Automated extraction of invoice details with over 90% accuracy  
- Natural language queries for instant information retrieval  
- Context-aware validation to minimize errors  
- Streamlined integration with n8n and Supabase for data storage  
- Real-time access to invoice history and status  

## How It Works

1. A Google Drive folder is monitored for newly uploaded invoice files  
2. Once detected, the file is automatically pulled into the workflow  
3. Data is extracted, validated, and saved to the database  
4. Users can query invoices in natural language (e.g., “Show me pending invoices”)  
5. Real-time insights and status updates help manage invoices effectively
