# Summary

 The first table, labeled `Sheet1`, contains a set of numerical data in four columns (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) for 16 entries. Each row represents a data point where columns Alpha, Beta, and Gamma have integer values, while Delta has a mix of integers and what appears to be a string represented as a hexadecimal number. The values in the rows show varying patterns without an apparent consistent trend.

The second table, labeled with a UUID (09060124-b5e7-4717-9d07-3c046eb), has four columns (ColA, ColB, ColC, ColD) and 4 entries. The last entry has a string value in its ColD column, which is represented as another UUID (affc7dad-52dc-4b98-9b5d-51e65d8a8ad0). The remaining entries appear to have numerical values in all columns without an obvious pattern.
